> It takes the requierments that have been gathered in the first two phase and expand them'
> Its main task is developing model & prototype of software

4) Negotiation (settlement & conflicts):

> Negotiation is between the Deveplopers and the customer about the limited availability of resources , delivery time , project cost & overall estimation of project

5) Specification (SRS document):
