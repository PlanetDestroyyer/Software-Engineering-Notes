WaterFall Modeling

> Winston Royce Introduced the WaterFall Model in 1970
> This Model is also known as Linear Sequentail Deveplement Model
> Each phase must be completed before th next phas can begin . Output of one phase will be input of next phase
> This model is named " Water Fall Model " , because its diagrammatic representaion of cascading waterfalls


Requierments --> Design --> Deveplement --> Testing --> Deployment --> Maintenance  


When to use WaterFall Model?

> When the requierments are constant and not changed reqularly
> Application is not complicated and Big
> A project is short & simple


WaterFall Model Phases

1) Requierment Analysis :
> The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requierments of the customer and to document them properly 
> They Discuss function , performance and interfacing requierments of the Software

2) Design Phase :
> All gathered requierments are converted into suitable Design
> It defines the overall Software Architecture together with high level and detailed design.
> High level design include algorithm , flowcart , Decision Tree , etc

3) Deveplement Phase :
> In this phase Software design is translated into source code using any suitable prgramming Language
> The Deveplopers first developed in small programs called units after that integraded it 

4)Testing Phase :
> In this phase, Testing all the testing activites to make sure that the syste meets the client requierments or not
> After combining all the unit modules , Integration testing is don for any faults and failures
> In case of any anomaly , report it .

5) Deployment & Maintenance Phase :
> The product is developed in the customer env or released into the market 
> In maintainance phase , there are somee issues which come up in the client env 
> To fix those issues , patched are released



Pro's Of WaterFall Model :

> Simple and easy to understand and use 
> Before the next phase of Deveplement , each phase must be completed
> Works well for small projects

Con's :

> Risk and Uncertainty
> Error can be fixed only during the phase
> Not suitable for big projects where changing are requierments
